## Works With

**Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Windsurf, Cline, Aider**, and anything that reads markdown.

## Install

```bash
npx codesight
```

That's it. Run it in any project root. No config, no setup, no API keys.

```bash
npx codesight --wiki                       # Generate wiki knowledge base (.codesight/wiki/)
npx codesight --init                       # Generate CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, codex.md, AGENTS.md
npx codesight --open                       # Open interactive HTML report in browser
npx codesight --mcp                        # Start as MCP server (13 tools) for Claude Code / Cursor
npx codesight --blast src/lib/db.ts        # Show blast radius for a file
npx codesight --profile claude-code        # Generate optimized config for a specific AI tool
npx codesight --benchmark                  # Show detailed token savings breakdown
npx codesight --mode knowledge             # Map knowledge base (.md notes → KNOWLEDGE.md)
npx codesight --mode knowledge ~/vault     # Map Obsidian vault, ADRs, meeting notes, retros
```

## Wiki Knowledge Base (v1.6.2)

Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) — but compiled from AST, not an LLM. Zero API calls. 200ms.

```bash
npx codesight --wiki
```

Generates `.codesight/wiki/` — a persistent knowledge base of your codebase that survives across every session:

```
.codesight/wiki/
  index.md      — catalog of all articles (~200 tokens) — read this at session start
  overview.md   — architecture, subsystems, high-impact files (~500 tokens)
  auth.md       — auth routes, middleware, session flow
  payments.md   — payment routes, webhook handling, billing flow
  database.md   — all models, fields, relations, high-impact DB files
  users.md      — user management routes and related models
  ui.md         — UI components with props
  log.md        — append-only record of every wiki operation
```

**Why this cuts token usage further:**

Instead of loading the full 5K token context map every conversation, your AI reads one targeted article:

| Question | Without wiki | With wiki |
|---|---|---|
| "How does auth work?" | ~12K tokens (reads 8+ files) | ~300 tokens (`auth.md`) |
| "What models exist?" | ~5K tokens (CODESIGHT.md) | ~400 tokens (`database.md`) |
| New session start | ~5K tokens (full reload) | ~200 tokens (`index.md`) |

**Persistent across sessions.** The wiki lives in `.codesight/wiki/`, committed to git. Every new Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex session starts with full codebase knowledge from the first message.

**Auto-regenerates.** Use `--watch` to keep the wiki current as you code. Use `--hook` to regenerate on every commit.

**3 new MCP tools** for wiki access:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `codesight_get_wiki_index` | Get the wiki catalog (~200 tokens) at session start |
| `codesight_get_wiki_article` | Read one article by name: `auth`, `database`, `payments`, etc. |
| `codesight_lint_wiki` | Health check: orphan articles, missing cross-links, stale content |

The key difference from general-purpose wiki tools: codesight already knows your routes, schema, blast radius, and middleware from AST — no LLM needed to extract code structure. The wiki is a narrative layer on top of data your codebase already contains.

## Knowledge Mode (v1.9.3)

Not just code — your decisions, meeting notes, ADRs, and retrospectives carry as much context as the codebase itself. `--mode knowledge` maps them the same way codesight maps code.

```bash
npx codesight --mode knowledge              # Scan current directory for .md files
npx codesight --mode knowledge ~/vault      # Scan an Obsidian vault
npx codesight --mode knowledge ./docs       # Scan a project docs folder
```

Outputs `.codesight/KNOWLEDGE.md` — a compact AI context primer:

```markdown
# Knowledge Map — my-project
> 47 notes · 12 decisions · 8 open questions · 2025-09-01 → 2026-04-01

## Key Decisions (12)
- [2026-03-20] Going with Polar.sh over Stripe Connect — simpler global payments
- [2026-03-15] Decided to use PostgreSQL — better JSON support and Drizzle compatibility
- [2026-02-10] Will use Redis for rate limiting — BullMQ already in stack

## Open Questions (8)
- Should we support PayPal later?
- When do we start the Stripe marketplace application?

## Note Index (47)

### Decision Records (8)
- `decisions/adr-002-payments.md` — 2026-03-20 — Going with Polar.sh over Stripe Connect
- `decisions/adr-001-database.md` — 2026-03-15 — We need a relational database...

### Meeting Notes (14)
### Retrospectives (6)
### Specs & PRDs (5)
### Research (4)
```

**What it detects automatically:**

| Note type | Signals |
|---|---|
| Decision records | ADR format (`## Decision`), "decided to", "going with", "chose X over Y" |
| Meeting notes | `Attendees:`, `Action items:`, filename: `standup`, `sync`, `1on1` |
| Retrospectives | "What went well", "Stop doing", filename: `retro`, `retrospective` |
| Specs / PRDs | `## Goals`, `## Requirements`, filename: `prd`, `spec`, `roadmap` |
| Research | filename: `research`, `analysis`, `benchmark`, `comparison` |
| Session logs | filename: `session`, `daily`, `weekly` |

**Supports:**
- Obsidian vaults (YAML frontmatter, `[[backlinks]]`, `#tags`)
- Notion exports (`.md` files with frontmatter)
- ADR tooling (`adr-tools`, `Log4brains`, raw markdown)
- Any folder of markdown files

**Used together:**

```
Read .codesight/CODESIGHT.md   → what the code does
Read .codesight/KNOWLEDGE.md   → why decisions were made
```

CI: add `npx codesight --mode knowledge` alongside your existing codesight step. Both files stay current on every push.

## Benchmarks (Real Projects)

Every number below comes from running codesight on real production codebases — both small SaaS projects (v1.6.2) and large open-source platforms with 4K–10K+ files (v1.6.4). Output tokens are measured from actual file size (chars / 4). Exploration tokens are estimated from what was extracted — routes × 400, models × 300, components × 250, etc. Route counts and model counts are cross-checked against actual source files.

### Three-Level Token Reduction

codesight saves tokens at two distinct layers. The wiki (v1.6.2) adds a second layer on top of the base savings:

| Project | Manual exploration | codesight scan | codesight --wiki (targeted) | **Total reduction** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS A** | 46,020 tokens | 3,936 tokens (11.7x) | ~550 tokens | **83.7x** |
| **SaaS B** | 26,130 tokens | 3,629 tokens (7.2x) | ~440 tokens | **59.4x** |
| **SaaS C** | 47,450 tokens | 4,162 tokens (11.4x) | ~360 tokens | **131.8x** |

**Average combined reduction: 91x.** The wiki's "targeted" number = reading `index.md` at session start (~200 tokens) + one relevant article (~160-350 tokens depending on project). Your AI never loads the full context map for targeted questions.

The two savings layers are independent and compound:

**Layer 1 — codesight scan** eliminates manual file exploration. Instead of your AI running glob/grep/read across 40-138 files to understand the project, it reads one pre-compiled map.

**Layer 2 — `--wiki`** eliminates loading the full map for every question. Instead of loading 3K-5K tokens of full context at session start, your AI reads a 200-token index and pulls the one relevant article (~160-350 tokens) for each question.

```
Without codesight:   AI reads 26K-47K tokens per session exploring files
With codesight:      AI reads ~3K-5K tokens (the compiled map)
With --wiki:         AI reads ~200 tokens at start + ~300 per targeted question
```

### Base Scan Results

| Project | Stack | Files | Routes | Models | Components | Output Tokens | Exploration Tokens | Savings | Scan Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS A** | Hono + Drizzle | 138 | 38 | 12 | 0 | 3,936 | 46,020 | **11.7x** | 186ms |
| **SaaS B** | Hono + Drizzle, 3 workspaces | 53 | 17 | 8 | 10 | 3,629 | 26,130 | **7.2x** | 201ms |
| **SaaS C** | FastAPI + MongoDB | 40 | 56 | 0 | 0 | 4,162 | 47,450 | **11.4x** | 890ms |

SaaS C has 0 models because it uses MongoDB — no SQL ORM declarations for codesight to parse. This is correct detection, not a false negative.

### Multi-Language OSS Benchmark (v1.6.7)

Tested against real open-source codebases spanning every supported language and framework. Output tokens are measured from actual file size. Exploration tokens are estimated (routes×400 + models×300 + components×250 + revisit multiplier). Zero false positives across all tests.

| Language | Stack | Files | Routes | Models | Components | Output tokens | Est. exploration | Savings |

| **Dart · Flutter** | Flutter + go_router | 204 | 10 | 0 | 89 | 8,500 | ~86,125 | **~10.1x** |

¹ Django project is GraphQL-first — 7 REST utility endpoints detected accurately, 0 false positives.
² High ratio on small boilerplate: Spring Boot route metadata compresses very well.
³ SvelteKit RealWorld app uses page routes (`+page.svelte`), not JSON API endpoints (`+server.ts`). 0 routes is correct.

**How exploration tokens are estimated:** `routes×400 + models×300 + components×250 + hot_files×150 + env_vars×30`, times a 1.3 revisit multiplier, minus the output size. This approximates what an AI would spend asking "what routes exist?", "show me the schema", etc. in a manual exploration session. Output token count is the actual measured file size.

### Wiki Breakdown (v1.6.2)

| Project | Full CODESIGHT.md | Wiki index only | Index + 1 article | Wiki articles generated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS A** | 3,936 tokens | ~200 tokens | ~550 tokens | 9 |
| **SaaS B** | 3,629 tokens | ~200 tokens | ~440 tokens | 11 |
| **SaaS C** | 4,162 tokens | ~200 tokens | ~360 tokens | 17 |

"How does auth work?" — without wiki: loads 3,945 tokens. With wiki: reads `auth.md` (~350 tokens). **11x improvement per targeted question, 84x total vs manual.**

### Detection Accuracy

Verified against actual source files. Route counts cross-checked against route definitions; schema models cross-checked against ORM table declarations.

| Project | Route Recall | Schema Recall | False Positives | Detection Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS A** | 38/43 (88%) | 12/12 (100%) | 0 | Schema: AST (Drizzle), Routes: AST (Hono) |
| **SaaS B** | 17/17 (100%) | 8/8 (100%) | 0 | Full AST (Hono + Drizzle + React) |
| **SaaS C** | 56/59 (~95%) | 0/0 (correct) | 0 | AST (FastAPI + MongoDB) |

SaaS A's 5 missed routes use dynamic `url.match(/pattern/)` inside request handlers — a developer pattern that static analysis cannot resolve at scan time. This is an inherent limit of static analysis, not a framework gap. SaaS C missed an estimated 3 of 59 FastAPI routes. Zero false positives across all three projects.

### Blast Radius Accuracy

Tested on a production SaaS: changing the database module correctly identified:

- **5 affected files** across API, auth, and server layers
- **All routes** that touch the database
- **12 affected models** (complete schema)
- **BFS depth:** 3 hops through the import graph

### What Gets Detected

Measured across the three benchmark projects:

| Detector | SaaS A (138 files) | SaaS B (53 files) | SaaS C (40 files) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Routes** | 38 | 17 | 56 |
| **Schema models** | 12 | 8 | 0 |
| **Components** | 0 | 10 | 0 |
| **Env vars** | 12 | 7 | 15 |
| **Hot files** | 20 | 20 | 20 |

## How It Works

![How codesight works: Codebase → AST Parser + Regex Fallback → Context Map → CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, codex.md, MCP Server](assets/how-it-works.jpg)

![8 parallel detectors: Routes, Schema, Components, Dep Graph, Middleware, Config, Libraries, Contracts](assets/detectors.jpg)

codesight runs all 8 detectors in parallel, then writes the results as structured markdown. The output is designed to be read by an AI in a single file load.

## What It Generates

```
.codesight/
  CODESIGHT.md     Combined context map (one file, full project understanding)
  routes.md        Every API route with method, path, params, and what it touches
  schema.md        Every database model with fields, types, keys, and relations
  components.md    Every UI component with its props
  libs.md          Every library export with function signatures
  config.md        Every env var (required vs default), config files, key deps
  middleware.md    Auth, rate limiting, CORS, validation, logging, error handlers
  graph.md         Which files import what and which break the most things if changed
  report.html      Interactive visual dashboard (with --html or --open)
```

## AST Precision

When TypeScript is installed in the project being scanned, codesight uses the actual TypeScript compiler API to parse your code structurally. No regex guessing.

![AST precision: TypeScript available → AST Parse, otherwise Regex fallback](assets/ast-precision.jpg)

| What AST enables | Regex alone |
|---|---|
| Follows `router.use('/prefix', subRouter)` chains | Misses nested routers |
| Combines `@Controller('users')` + `@Get(':id')` into `/users/:id` | May miss prefix |
| Parses `router({ users: userRouter })` tRPC nesting | Line-by-line matching |
| Extracts exact Drizzle field types from `.primaryKey().notNull()` chains | Pattern matching |
| Gets React props from TypeScript interfaces and destructuring | Regex on `{ prop }` |
| Detects middleware in route chains: `app.get('/path', auth, handler)` | Not captured |
| Filters out non-route calls like `c.get('userId')` | May false-positive |

AST detection is reported in the output:

```
Analyzing... done (AST: 60 routes, 18 models, 16 components)
```

No configuration needed. If TypeScript is in your `node_modules`, AST kicks in automatically. Works with npm, yarn, and pnpm (including strict mode). Falls back to regex for non-TypeScript projects or frameworks without AST support.

**AST-supported frameworks:** Express, Hono, Fastify, Koa, Elysia (route chains + middleware), NestJS (decorator combining + guards), tRPC (router nesting + procedure types), Drizzle (field chains + relations), TypeORM (entity decorators), React (props from interfaces + destructuring + forwardRef/memo).

## Routes

Not just paths. Methods, URL parameters, what each route touches (auth, database, cache, payments, AI, email, queues), and where the handler lives. Detects routes across 25+ frameworks automatically.

Example output:

```markdown
- `GET` `/api/users/me` [auth, db, cache]
- `PUT` `/api/users/me` [auth, db]
- `POST` `/api/projects` [auth, db, payment]
- `GET` `/api/projects/:id` params(id) [auth, db]
- `POST` `/webhooks/stripe` [db, payment]
- `GET` `/health`
```

## Schema

Models, fields, types, primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, relations. Parsed directly from your ORM definitions via AST. No need to open migration files.

Example output:

```markdown
### user
- id: text (pk)
- name: text (required)
- email: text (unique, required)
- role: text (default, required)
- stripeCustomerId: text (fk)

### project
- id: uuid (default, pk)
- ownerId: text (fk, required)
- name: text (required)
- settings: jsonb (required)
- _relations_: ownerId -> user.id
```

## Dependency Graph

The files imported the most are the ones that break the most things when changed. codesight finds them and tells your AI to be careful.

Example output:

```markdown
## Most Imported Files (change these carefully)
- `src/types/index.ts` — imported by **20** files
- `src/db/index.ts` — imported by **12** files
- `src/lib/auth.ts` — imported by **8** files
- `src/lib/cache.ts` — imported by **6** files
- `src/lib/env.ts` — imported by **5** files
```

## Blast Radius

![Blast radius: changing src/db/index.ts ripples through 10 files across 3 hops](assets/blast-radius.jpg)

BFS through the import graph finds all transitively affected files, routes, models, and middleware.

```bash
npx codesight --blast src/db/index.ts
```

Example output:

```
  Blast Radius: src/db/index.ts
  Depth: 3 hops

  Affected files (10):
    src/api/users.ts
    src/api/projects.ts
    src/api/webhooks.ts
    src/auth/session.ts
    src/jobs/notifications.ts
    src/server.ts
    src/auth/index.ts
    src/jobs/cron.ts
    src/cli.ts
    src/index.ts

  Affected routes (33):
    GET /api/users/me — src/api/users.ts
    POST /api/projects — src/api/projects.ts
    POST /webhooks/stripe — src/api/webhooks.ts
    ...

  Affected models: user, session, account, project,
    subscription, notification, audit_log
```

Your AI can also query blast radius through the MCP server before making changes.

## Environment Audit

Every env var across your codebase, flagged as required or has default, with the exact file where it is referenced.

Example output:

```markdown
- `DATABASE_URL` **required** — .env.example
- `REDIS_URL` (has default) — .env.example
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` **required** — src/lib/payments.ts
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` **required** — .env.example
- `RESEND_API_KEY` **required** — .env.example
- `JWT_SECRET` **required** — src/lib/auth.ts
```

## Token Benchmark

See exactly where your token savings come from:

```bash
npx codesight --benchmark
```

Example output (SaaS A — 138 files, Hono + Drizzle):

```
  Token Savings Breakdown:
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ What codesight found         │ Exploration cost   │

  │  12 schema models            │ ~ 3,600 tokens     │
  │   0 components               │       0 tokens     │
  │  30 library files            │ ~ 6,000 tokens     │
  │  12 env vars                 │ ~ 1,200 tokens     │

  │  20 hot files                │ ~ 3,000 tokens     │
  │ 138 files (search overhead)  │ ~11,040 tokens     │
  ├──────────────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
  │ codesight output             │ ~ 3,936 tokens     │
  │ Manual exploration (1.3x)    │ ~46,020 tokens     │
  │ SAVED PER CONVERSATION       │ ~42,084 tokens     │
  └──────────────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

### How Token Savings Are Calculated

Each detector type maps to a measured token cost that an AI would spend to discover the same information manually:

| What codesight finds | Tokens saved per item | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Each route | ~400 tokens | AI reads the handler file, greps for the path, reads middleware |
| Each schema model | ~300 tokens | AI opens migration/ORM files, parses fields manually |
| Each component | ~250 tokens | AI opens component files, reads prop types |
| Each library export | ~200 tokens | AI greps for exports, reads signatures |
| Each env var | ~100 tokens | AI greps for `process.env`, reads .env files |
| Each file scanned | ~80 tokens | AI runs glob/grep operations to find relevant files |

The 1.3x multiplier accounts for AI revisiting files during multi-turn conversations. These estimates are conservative. A developer manually verified that Claude Code spends 40-70K tokens exploring the same projects that codesight summarizes in 3-5K tokens.

## Roku / BrightScript / SceneGraph

codesight treats Roku channels as first-class projects. The `manifest` file at the channel root anchors detection — the same file Roku itself uses to identify a channel, so zero configuration is needed for the common case.

**Standard single-channel layout** (about 90% of Roku repos, matches the Roku docs' getting-started template and projects like `rokucommunity/brighterscript-template`):

```
/
  manifest
  source/         # Main.brs + shared .brs libraries
  components/     # *.xml + paired *.brs component handlers
  images/
```

codesight also recognizes the `rokucommunity/brighterscript-template` layout where the channel lives under `src/` and the root carries a `bsconfig.json` for BrighterScript tooling.

**Multi-channel monorepo layout** (less common — used by larger codebases that ship several branded channels from one repo with `roku-deploy` + `gulp` to merge a shared `common/` layer with per-channel assets at build time):

```
/
  package.json      # depends on roku-deploy, gulp
  gulpfile.js
  src/apps/
    common/         # shared layer, merged into every channel at build
    creatorA/
      manifest
    creatorB/
      manifest
```

This is detected via a strict structural signal: no manifest at root, `roku-deploy` in deps, and a `common/` directory with at least 2 sibling directories that each have their own `manifest`. When the signal matches, each channel (plus `common/`) is registered as a workspace.

### Mappings to codesight's data model

| codesight concept | Roku equivalent |
|---|---|
| Routes | Screens — every child element with an `id` declared in the Scene XML's `<children>`. `method = VIEW` by default, upgraded to `MODAL` if a navigation call-site passes a literal `true` as the second argument. |
| Schema | Every SceneGraph component XML whose `<interface>` has at least one `<field>` — the typed contract is the model. |
| Components | Every `<component name="..." extends="...">` XML (views, tasks, scenes, modals). Props = interface fields. |
| Libraries | `.brs` / `.bs` files outside `components/` — top-level `function`/`sub` plus BrighterScript `class` / `namespace` / `enum` / `interface`. |
| Middleware | `observeField` subscriptions, `m.global.AddField` registrations. BugsnagTask / RudderstackTask recognized when present. |
| Dependencies | `<script uri="pkg:/..." />` includes in component XML + `import "pkg:/..."` in `.bs`. |
| Events | Observed fields (`system: scenegraph-observer`) and Rudderstack event names (`system: rudderstack`). |
| Config | The Roku `manifest` key/value lines surfaced as `manifest.<name>` pseudo env-vars. |

### Configurable navigation helpers

Many Roku projects use a custom helper to switch the visible screen (names vary: `ShowScreen`, `pushScreen`, `NavigateTo`, `showView`, etc.). These are used as optional enrichment to tag routes as `MODAL`. Defaults cover the common conventions; override with `rokuScreenHelpers` in your codesight config if your project uses a different name:

```json
{
  "rokuScreenHelpers": ["Router.push", "openScreen"]
}
```

Routes are still detected from `<children>` even when no helper is present or when no call-site matches.

### Example output

```markdown
- `VIEW` `/homeView` — components/views/HomeView.xml
- `VIEW` `/detailView` — components/views/DetailView.xml
- `MODAL` `/errorModal` — components/modals/ErrorModal.xml

### DataTask
- requestUrl: string
- response: object
```

## AI Config Generation

```bash
npx codesight --init
```

Generates ready-to-use instruction files for every major AI coding tool at once:

| File | Tool |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code |
| `.cursorrules` | Cursor |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot |
| `codex.md` | OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `AGENTS.md` | OpenAI Codex agents |

Each file is pre-filled with your project's stack, architecture, high-impact files, and required env vars. Your AI reads it on startup and starts with full context from the first message.

## MCP Server (13 Tools)

```bash
npx codesight --mcp
```

Runs as a Model Context Protocol server. Claude Code and Cursor call it directly to get project context on demand.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codesight": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["codesight", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**OpenAI Codex CLI** (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.codesight]
command = "npx"
args = ["codesight", "--mcp"]
startup_timeout_sec = 60
```

> **Codex timeout note:** `npx` has to resolve the package on first run which can exceed the default 30-second timeout. Set `startup_timeout_sec = 60` or install globally (`npm install -g codesight`) and use `command = "codesight"` instead — global installs start significantly faster.

![MCP Server: Claude Code/Cursor ↔ codesight MCP Server → 6 specialized tools + session cache](assets/mcp-server.jpg)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `codesight_get_wiki_index` | Wiki catalog (~200 tokens) — read at session start |
| `codesight_get_wiki_article` | Read one wiki article by name: `auth`, `database`, `payments`, etc. |
| `codesight_lint_wiki` | Health check: orphan articles, missing cross-links |
| `codesight_scan` | Full project scan (~3K-5K tokens) |
| `codesight_get_summary` | Compact overview (~500 tokens) |
| `codesight_get_routes` | Routes filtered by prefix, tag, or method |
| `codesight_get_schema` | Schema filtered by model name |
| `codesight_get_blast_radius` | Impact analysis before changing a file |
| `codesight_get_env` | Environment variables (filter: required only) |
| `codesight_get_hot_files` | Most imported files with configurable limit |
| `codesight_get_events` | Background events: BullMQ queues, Celery tasks, Kafka topics, Redis pub/sub, EventEmitter |
| `codesight_get_coverage` | Test coverage map: which routes and models have test files |
| `codesight_refresh` | Force re-scan (results are cached per session) |

Your AI asks for exactly what it needs instead of loading the entire context map. Session caching means the first call scans, subsequent calls return instantly.

## AI Tool Profiles

```bash
npx codesight --profile claude-code
npx codesight --profile cursor
npx codesight --profile codex
npx codesight --profile copilot
npx codesight --profile windsurf
```

Generates an optimized config file for a specific AI tool. Each profile includes your project summary, stack info, high-impact files, required env vars, and tool-specific instructions on how to use codesight outputs. For Claude Code, this includes MCP tool usage instructions. For Cursor, it points to the right codesight files. Each profile writes to the correct file for that tool.

## Visual Report

```bash
npx codesight --open
```

Opens an interactive HTML dashboard in your browser. Routes table with method badges and tags. Schema cards with fields and relations. Dependency hot files with impact bars. Env var audit. Token savings breakdown. Useful for onboarding or just seeing your project from above.

## GitHub Action

Add to your CI pipeline to keep context fresh on every push:

```yaml
name: codesight
on: [push]
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm install -g codesight && codesight
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: codesight
          path: .codesight/
```

## Watch Mode and Git Hook

**Watch mode** re-scans automatically when your code changes:

```bash
npx codesight --watch
```

Only triggers on source and config files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.go`, `.prisma`, `.env`, etc.). Ignores `node_modules`, build output, and non-code files. Shows which files changed before each re-scan. Your config (disabled detectors, plugins) is preserved across re-scans.

**Git hook** regenerates context on every commit:

```bash
npx codesight --hook
```

Context stays fresh without thinking about it.

## All Options

```bash
npx codesight                              # Scan current directory
npx codesight ./my-project                 # Scan specific directory
npx codesight --wiki                       # Generate wiki knowledge base
npx codesight --init                       # Generate AI config files
npx codesight --open                       # Open visual HTML report
npx codesight --html                       # Generate HTML report without opening
npx codesight --mcp                        # Start MCP server (13 tools)
npx codesight --blast src/lib/db.ts        # Show blast radius for a file
npx codesight --profile claude-code        # Optimized config for specific tool
npx codesight --watch                      # Watch mode (add --wiki to auto-regenerate wiki)
npx codesight --wiki --watch               # Watch + auto-regenerate wiki on changes
npx codesight --hook                       # Install git pre-commit hook (includes wiki)
npx codesight --benchmark                  # Detailed token savings breakdown
npx codesight --json                       # Output as JSON
npx codesight --mode knowledge             # Map .md knowledge base → KNOWLEDGE.md
npx codesight --mode knowledge ~/vault     # Map Obsidian vault or any .md folder
npx codesight --max-tokens 50000           # Trim output to fit token budget
npx codesight --since HEAD~5               # Show routes from last 5 commits only
npx codesight -o .ai-context               # Custom output directory
npx codesight -d 5                         # Limit directory depth
```

## How It Compares

| | codesight | File concatenation tools | AST-based tools (e.g. code-review-graph) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Parsing** | AST (TypeScript compiler) + regex fallback | None | Tree-sitter + SQLite |
| **Token reduction** | 7x-12x base scan; 60-131x with targeted wiki queries | 1x (dumps everything) | 8x reported |
| **Route detection** | 25+ frameworks, auto-detected | None | Limited |
| **Schema parsing** | 8 ORMs with field types and relations | None | Varies |
| **Blast radius** | BFS through import graph | None | Yes |
| **AI tool profiles** | 5 tools (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Windsurf) | None | Auto-detect |
| **MCP tools** | 11 specialized tools with session caching | None | 22 tools |
| **Setup** | `npx codesight` (zero deps, zero config) | Copy/paste | `pip install` + optional deps |
| **Dependencies** | Zero (borrows TS from your project) | Varies | Tree-sitter, SQLite, NetworkX, etc. |
| **Language** | TypeScript (zero runtime deps) | Varies | Python |
| **Scan time** | 185-290ms (small), 0.9-2.8s (10K files) | Varies | Under 2s reported |

codesight is purpose-built for the problem most developers actually have: giving their AI assistant enough context to be useful without wasting tokens on file exploration. It focuses on structured extraction (routes, schema, components, dependencies) rather than general-purpose code graph analysis.
